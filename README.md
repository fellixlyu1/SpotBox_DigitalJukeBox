<h2><strong>Setting Up Your Spotify Developer Account</strong></h2>

<p>To begin, you'll need a Spotify account, a Spotify developer account, and a safe Wi-Fi connection. To create a developer account, go to: developer.spotify.com. Once you've created your Developer account, go to the "Dashboard" and click the "Create App" button. Once you've created your app, go to the settings and copy the "Client ID" and the "Client Secret" at the top.</p>

CLIENT_ID=(your client id here)
CLIENT_SECRET=(your client secret here)
